  First compile the FreeType 2 library, then say `make'.

  Note  that  the  demonstration  programs  include  a  tiny  graphics
  sub-system that includes `drivers' to display Windows on Win32, X11,
  and OS/2.  The build system should automatically detect which driver
  to use based on the current platform.

  UNIX USERS:

    When building the demos, the build system tries to detect your X11
    path  by  looking for  the  patterns  `X11/bin', `X11R6/bin',  and
    "X11R5/bin" in your current path  (in this order).  If no X11 path
    is found, some demo programs  will not be able to display graphics
    and  will fail.   If you  have X11  in an  unusual place,  use the
    X11_PATH make  variable.  More  than one directory,  if necessary,
    must be separated with spaces.  Example:

        make X11_PATH="/usr/openwin /usr/local/X11R6"

    If  you don't  have X11  at all,  fix the  definition of  the EXES
    variable as described in the top-level Makefile.
